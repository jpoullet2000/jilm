## Installation

TO BE DONE

## Get started

First download a GPTj model, for instance `ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin` that can be installed [here](https://gpt4all.io/models/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin) for instance.

Then copy the `.env.template` file into `.env` and modify it.
Only the line with the model path should be modified:

```
JILM_LLM_MODEL_PATH="/path/to/ggml-gpt4all-j-v1.3-groovy.bin"
```
